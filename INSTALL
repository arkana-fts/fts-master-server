 Requirements
--------------

  You will need the following things for the Arkana-FTS Server to work:
    * CMake version 3.1 or above
    * a threading library like pthreads
    * a working MySQL 5.x server (Tested with version 5.6)
    * the MySQL 5.x C Client library (Tested with version 5.6)

  It is known to compile in GCC 4.9

 How to install the Arkana-FTS Server
--------------------------------------

  First of all, you need to create a new database user, know his password and
  create a new database the Arkana-FTS server will use.

  Next, you have to compile the server:
  Change into the directory "build", by typing

    > cd build

  There you must call CMake to check your system and create the Makefiles. This
  is also the right time to select some options of the server.

  I recommend you to use a CMake GUI, like ccmake on linux systems:

    > ccmake ..

  There, press "c" once (configure), then customize everything you want. This
  is also the time to type in the MySQL connection credentials.
  Another recommendation is to set the cmake install directory to where you
  want the server executable to reside and choose a writeable directory to
  store the logfiles in.

  When done choosing your options, press "c" again and then "g".

  If everything went fine, you should now have a Makefile in your directory
  and thus be able to run make

    > make

  If it all went fine, run make install in order to copy the server to the
  location you chose beforehand.

  Finally, you need to setup the database: start the mysql commandline client:

    > mysql -u USERNAME -p

  After entering the correct password, you get to the MySQL prompt, where you
  have to select the database you will work on:

    # use DATABASENAME

  Then you can create all the tables needed by the Arkana-FTS server by just
  running the script 'create.sql':

    # source create.sql
    # exit

  That's all! don't worry if the script prints some warnings, they are known.

Notes on the logfiles
=====================

  The player/games number file will be created by the server and store the
  actual number of players logged in/games being played.

  The error/actions/network logging files will also be created by the server in
  the log directory and will keep track of encountered errors, actions done by
  the players and network traffic respectively. Thus the two latter files may
  become quite large, that's why you can limit their size. After reaching the
  limit size, the file gets renamed (it gets the current datetime appended) and
  a new one is created.

  The server needs to have write access to the path you choose for those four
  files! If the server can't access them, they will be created in the home
  directory of the executing user. If this home directory doesn't exist or is
  not writeable, the files will just be ignored.
